# 12-Employee-Tracker

## Description

This project is a CLI tracker application. This is an application that manages departments, roles, and employees for a company with the ability to view, add, update, and delete those departments, roles, and employees.

During this project I got to practice my javascrippt skills with a database such as mysql.

## Installation

To use this app, you will need node.js installed. If you do not habe node.js installed here is the [link](https://nodejs.org/en/) to do so.
Once you have Node.js installed. You will have to clone this repository and then install node with 'npm i' from the command line in the directory of where you saved the project. This will install all the neccessary dependencies to use this project. Use the schema file to create the database and you can also use the seeds file to seed the database with examples. Rename the '.env.EXAMPLE' to just '.env' and fill it in with your own information. Now you will be able to use the application to track employees.

## Usage

After the application is installed, go to the main directory of the project. From your terminal you will run 'node index.js' to start the app up. Use the up and down arrow keys to select between the different options and use the enter key to choose. When given a checkbox type prompt, use the spacebar to make your selections. Once you are ready use the enter key to show your selections. Use the 'Back to Main Menu' and 'Quit' option when you are done using the application.
